============

a bag of nasty js for another GCS competition. basic multiplayer using node.js, dnode, and shoe.
I wrote this over the course of one night, or maybe it was two; I don't remember.
It's really nasty and I'm not sure if or when I'll come back to fix it.

It works and it's playable. Just do npm install and then node server.js.
(Change the port and whatever else you need)

You are a square and you need to shoot squares of the other color.
Colors are only revealed when you are underneath a lamppost.
Don't shoot your teammates!
The incentive to go under lampposts is bombs. You can pick up bombs from under lampposts.
These bombs can be used to clear the surrounding 8 squares of where it is placed.
Click/touch other squares to shoot at them.
Click/touch a(n unlit) bomb on the ground to pick it up.
Click/touch the bomb you are carrying to light it and set it down.
